# Immersive Computing Project 1 - Augmented Reality Language Learning App

## Assigned requirements:

Create a Unity3D application that has a connection to some backend service like a database/web service hosted on a third party cloud provider like AWS/Azure/Heroku

Ideas can be the following:

- AR Online Shopping Catalogue
- AR Step by step instruction application
- AR Tourism Application
- AR Data Visualization
- AR Manual/Teaching Tool
- AR IoT

## Summary

Our project idea is to create a Language Recognition AR game,
The user will cycle through 3 different modes of learning that are:

1. 3D image pops up and user has to verbally say the name of the object
2. Multiple 3D images pop up along with a word and the user has to tap the item that is associated with the word
3. Multiple words pop up along with one 3D image and the user has to tap on the word associated with the object.

For the cloud component: Each correct answer will render a point and that score will be stored, we will also track their performance for each objects (stats such as # times correct / wrong) and then show the stats on a menu.

Login will be supported in a trusted manner, that is, users will be asked for their username and then they are logged in to that profile, no password required.

We will attempt to use a cloud provider for the speech recogniition capabilities.
